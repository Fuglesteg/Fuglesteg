My name is Andreas Fuglesteg Dale, I'm a passionate fullstack developer from Norway!

I currently work as a consultant in Microsoft technologies.

In my spare time I work on Lisp and open source projects.
I am also very interested in game development and I am currently working on my own game engine.
